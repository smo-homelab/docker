I like to play Minecraft, so I'm gonna run my own servers.

There are several mods and resource packs that I like to use. As of right now, I'm going to be listing them directly in my mc-server.yaml file.

I am not endorsing any of these mods or resource packs. I just merely like them.
I will do my best to get everything updated, and make things smoother as I learn more.
